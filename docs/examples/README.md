### About
This is something that I am most excited about!  But it is only a sneak preview!

### Usage
Do `bower install` to get the libraries into the right location.  Then you should be able to view these html files in your browser!

### All rights reserved (for now)
For now, this work is not licensed for reuse because it isn't finished.  The work is very important to me, and I would like a chance to finish it before someone else even thinks about publishing it!  So for the time being this stuff is Â©2017 Micah Fitch, All Rights Reserved.
